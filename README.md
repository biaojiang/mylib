# Project Overview

This project contains various scripts and tools for different purposes. Below is a list of the scripts and their descriptions.

Some scripts were made by guiding **ChatGPT 4o/3.5**.

### Manage Overlapping Photos

E.g., in Dropbox, between Camera Uploads and other folders containing photos with Dropbox name convention automation.

### Undo Dropbox Naming Convention
- [Undo Dropbox Naming Convention](docs/fish/undo_dropbox_naming.md): Script to rename files that follow the Dropbox Camera Uploads naming convention.

This script failed in `zsh`, so `fish` was used.
